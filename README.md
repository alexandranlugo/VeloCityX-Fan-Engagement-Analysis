# VeloCityX-Fan-Engagement-Analysis
This project analyzes user interaction data from the fictional VeloCityX app, focused on autonomous racing events. The purpose of this project is to identify trends in user behavior, such as which users are most likely to purchase virtual merchandise, and to apply clustering techniques to segment users based on their activities. The insights drawn from this analysis help inform strategies to enhance fan engagement and drive monetization.

# Key Objectives
- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Investigate trends in user engagement and merchandise purchases.
- Apply clustering techniques to identify different user segments.
- Generate actionable insights to optimize user engagement and increase monetization.

# Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Processed the dataset to handle missing values and prepare it for analysis.
- **Trend Analysis:** Correlation analysis to understand which users are more likely to purchase virtual merchandise and what activities correlate with higher engagement.
- **Cluster Analysis:** Grouped users into clusters based on behaviors such as fan challenges completed, merchandise purchases, sponsorship interactions, and time spent on Live 360.
- **Proposed Fan Challenge:** Based on the analysis, a new fan challenge was proposed to increase user engagement and monetization.

# Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating visualizations and heatmaps.
- **Scikit-learn:** Used for clustering (KMeans) and data standardization.

# Summary of Key Insights
- **Fan Challenges and Merchandise Purchases:** Users who participate in more fan challenges are slightly more likely to purchase merchandise.
- **Sponsorship Interactions:** Users who interact with sponsorship ads show moderate engagement with merchandise purchases.
- **Cluster Analysis:** Identified three main user segments with distinct behaviors, including a group highly engaged with sponsorships and another group that excels in both fan challenges and merchandise purchases.
- **Proposed Fan Challenge:** A new challenge designed to increase both sponsorship interaction and merchandise purchases, driving further engagement and monetization.
